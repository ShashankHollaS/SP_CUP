## PhasePlots
Plots the phase of received signal for all cases

## Configurations
Plots the IRS Configuration (colored plot) for all cases

## Combined 
Plots both the Phaseplots and Configurations together using subplots

## Pairs
Generates the set of pairs in Dataset1 (just indices)

## Pairs2
Used to get a vector that gives the Noise (subtraction of received signals of same config).

## Noise
Used to get the sigma and mu of the distribution. Use the last line to generate random noise.

Note : Keep Pairs2 and Noise in the same directory and just run Noise
